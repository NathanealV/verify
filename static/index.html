                        <p><u>How does this work?</u> Once you have selected your year role and agreed to our rules, you can log in using Discord. Discord will then give us your user ID, allowing our bot to give you the 'Verified' role and a year role corresponding to your exam session. These will grant you access to the rest of the server.</p>
            
                        <p><u>Is my data safe?</u> Yes. The entire Discord login process is handled by Discord themselves - we never see your email, password, or IP address. The only thing Discord shows us is your user ID, which is not stored anywhere.</p>
            
                        <p><u>I need help!</u> If you're having any issues, or have any questions or concerns, please contact the staff team by DMing the <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/466271091686375424" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"><span class="ping">@Mod-Mail</span></a> bot on the Discord server (top of the sidebar).
